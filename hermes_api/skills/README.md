# Hermes Markdown Skills

Hermes can load custom skills from Markdown files in this directory.

Default directory:

- `/app/hermes_api/skills` inside Docker
- `/Users/christopher/HermesWorkspace/Projects/Hermes Burpsuite Agent/hermes_api/skills` on host

Override path with:

- `HERMES_SKILLS_DIR=/some/path`

## Skill File Format

Each `*.md` file must start with YAML frontmatter:

```md
